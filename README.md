# Classical Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on implementations of **classical machine learning algorithms** using Python and popular libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone, well-commented Python script or notebook, suitable for both educational and professional purposes.
