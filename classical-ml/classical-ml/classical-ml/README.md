 Classical Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains practical implementations of classical machine learning algorithms using Python.

 ðŸ“Œ Algorithms Covered:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Means Clustering
- PCA
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
- Regression Models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial)
Each project is written as a separate Python file with clean and commented code.
> These implementations are part of my AI learning portfolio and follow a structured learning path toward research-level proficiency.
